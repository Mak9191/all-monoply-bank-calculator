# all-monoply-bank-calculator

Usually we humans always lose tokens or money in every board game. So to resolve this problem with a multiplayer business game in which we have lost cash and state tickets, 
this website allows 2 to 6 players to play the game.There will be virtual money and secure transactions among the players with no false calculations. 
Each player can buy the state or sell the state to the bank or the other player. A list of states that each person owned is also provided in the UI.
The player can give a fine to the bank or can take money from the bank as an incentive (i.e according to the game ).The players can send money to each other,
so if a player wants to lend money, he or she can do so at their own risk. If a player has zero balance and no states, he or she will lose and cannot play further. 
You can end the game at any time by clicking the announce the winner button, and it will announce the winner's rank. and you can then shortlist the players so that if a person is bankrupt, then he/she will be removed from the game.
